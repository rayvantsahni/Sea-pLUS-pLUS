# Pass-By-Reference
**Pass-by-reference** refers to **passing parameters to a function by using references**. When called, the function can modify the value of the arguments by using the reference passed in.

This allows us to:

* Modify the value of the function arguments.
* Avoid making copies of a variable/object for performance reasons.
