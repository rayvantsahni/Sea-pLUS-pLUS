### Introduction
A computerâ€™s memory is a sequence of bytes. We can number the bytes from 0 to the last one. Each number, known as an `address`, represents a location in the memory.
Everything we put into memory has an address.

For example, when we declare and initialize an `int` variable named `score`:

_int power = 200;_

This will set aside an **int-size** piece of memory for the variable **score** somewhere and put the value `200` into that memory.
