A computerâ€™s memory is a sequence of bytes. We can number the bytes from 0 to the last one. Each number, known as an address, represents a location in the memory.

Everything we put into memory has an address.

For example, when we declare and initialize an int variable named power:

int power = 9000;
This will set aside an int-size piece of memory for the variable power somewhere and put the value 9000 into that memory.
