The asterisk sign `*` a.k.a. the dereference operator is used to obtain the value pointed to by a variable. This can be done by preceding the name of a pointer variable with `*`.

_int blah = *ptr;_

The double meaning of the `*` symbol can be tricky at first, so make sure to note:

* When `*` is used in a declaration, it is creating a pointer.
* When `*` is not used in a declaration, it is a dereference operator.
